# Simple API

A silly, but tiny and easy to understand API that supports a subset of commands to 
manage rabbits.

This is a learning tool, so please note:
- not all RESTful operations are supported
- this will perform horribly, have concurrency issues and won't scale 
- it is not distributed and data will be lost on killing the container
- there is no API versioning
- this is not secure
- there is no validation
- there is no automatic generation of ids

But it anybody can understand it and its less than 2MB
